# Docker LoongArch64 cross-compiler target
#
# This docker target is used for building loongarch64 tests. As it also
# needs to be able to build QEMU itself in CI we include it's
# build-deps. It is also a "stand-alone" image so as not to be
# triggered by re-builds on other base images given it takes a long
# time to build.
